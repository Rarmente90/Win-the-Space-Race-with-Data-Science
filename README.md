# 🚀 Win the Space Race with Data Science: SpaceX Rocket Landing Prediction

In this project, I developed a **machine learning pipeline** to predict whether the first stage of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. This prediction is critical for estimating the cost of each launch, as SpaceX significantly reduces costs by reusing its rockets, lowering launch expenses from $165 million to $62 million per mission.

## 📊 Methodology and Tools  
- Analysis of historical launch data and interactive visualizations.  
- Development of predictive models to assess key factors for landing success.  
- Model optimization to improve prediction accuracy.  

## 🔍 Practical Application  
The model enables accurate launch cost estimation and can be used by other companies to compete in launch bids against SpaceX.  

This project strengthened my skills in **data science, machine learning, and predictive analysis**. 👨‍💻
